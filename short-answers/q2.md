# Question

Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer

Labels for every input help both you and the user determine the context of what the information is for, and thus, what to do with it. Say you get "red" from an unlabeled input element. What the hell could it be? The color of the user's car? The user's favorite color? Their nailpolish color? We don't know because there isn't a label on it.

The two ways to put a label on an input element are:

1. Using the label element, target the input element using its id and the "for" attribute in the label element. Set the label element before the input element in the html file:

```html
<label for="idiot">Say "hi" to the idiot.</label>
<input type="text" id="idiot-greeting" />
```

2. You can also nest the input element inside of the label element:

```html
<label for="idiot">
  Say "hi" to the idiot.

  <input type="text" id="idiot-greeting" />
</label>
```

Nice job explaining the importance of labels and the methods to associate them with inputs; however, ensure your language is professional and mention the role of labels in accessibility.
