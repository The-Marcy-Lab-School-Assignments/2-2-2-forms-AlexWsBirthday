# Question
Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```
to this:
```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?

# Answer
When a user interacts with an input element on the html and the information has nowhere to go (say, a server to store the information and respond), the page is refreshed and the data sent become query parameters that the url of the website reflects. In the case of google as the lesson showed, it's fine for the most part if its innocent information, but you don't want your private account information for any website to be displayed like that. 

What you can do is create an event handler which responds to the user input with a myriad of different things having to do with the information they gave.
